	Complete recruiting data doesn't come over to the onboarding system
	Offer letter/docs don't come from onboarding tool
	Recruiting module of Ultipro, Onboarding module as well


	Employee Hiring/Onboarding
		Candidate signs offer letter, email is sent out notifying everyone is done
		Candidate gets into onboarding tool w/ limited info
		Multi Person based validations with additional data entry 

	No documented process today, unsure of aht they want as their end result other than fields being mapped. Will require significant post sales support to keep value relative
